### Hi there, I'm Jim Mickelsson.

I am an IT Security Student at Yrkeshögskolan Enköping with a background in Technical Onboarding for B2B SaaS.

My work included handling template logic (HTML/CSS/Mustache) and guiding enterprise clients through secure technical setups. I am now applying that operational mindset to IT Security and Data Engineering.

### Featured Work: My Learning Portfolio

I document my technical journey, labs, and code in my central knowledge base. This is where you will find my SQL visualizations, Cisco Packet Tracer labs, and Python automation scripts.
